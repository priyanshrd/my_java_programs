# My First GitHub Repository ðŸŒŸ  

When I was in **Class 9**, my uncle challenged me by giving me two simple Java tasks:  

1. **`HelloWorld.java`** â€“ The classic first step every coder takes.  
2. **`VehicleTyreCounter.java`** â€“ A fun little program that calculates how many bikes (2 tyres), autos (3 tyres) and cars (4 tyres) could exist given a total number of tyres.  

Excited and thinking GitHub was a place for discussions (like a forum!), I uploaded these programs hoping people would talk about them - [First Original](https://github.com/priyanshrd/my_first_github_project). Of course, nobody didâ€”because, well, itâ€™s just "Hello World" and a basic math problem. ðŸ˜…  

But looking back now, this repository is a sweet reminder of where my coding journey beganâ€”a time when even the simplest programs felt like big achievements.
